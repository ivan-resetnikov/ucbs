## Overview

A reusable, extensible build system for C/C++ projects.

Used in all of my projects since February 16th, successor of [dev-env-v3](https://github.com/ivan-resetnikov/dev-env-v3).

## Installation
- Obtain the [latest release](https://github.com/ivan-resetnikov/ucbs/releases) from GitHub.
- Place it somewhere in your C/C++ project

## Usage Guide
- **TODO**

## Extesibility
> The default package provides an array of default extensions (STL of sorts). You are free to remove them as in some cases it might vbe consideret bloat.
